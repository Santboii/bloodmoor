# BloodMoore

A browser-based real-time PvP dueling game inspired by Diablo 2 Resurrected duels. Two players face off as Fire Sorceresses in an isometric stone arena.

No accounts, no progression — just pick a name, share a link, and duel.

## Gameplay

- **Movement:** WASD or arrow keys
- **Spell selection:** `1` / `2` / `3`
- **Cast:** Left-click (aim at cursor)
- **Fire Wall:** Press `2`, then click-and-drag to set wall direction and length

### Spells

| Key | Spell | Damage | Mana | Cooldown |
|-----|-------|--------|------|----------|
| 1 | Fireball | 80–120 | 25 | 0.5s |
| 2 | Fire Wall | 40/sec | 60 | 3s |
| 3 | Meteor | 200–280 AoE | 100 | 5s |

Fireballs and Fire Walls are blocked by pillars. Meteor falls from the sky and bypasses them.

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

```bash
# Install dependencies

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Client | Vite + TypeScript + Three.js |
| Rendering | Pixelated 3D — 360p internal render, nearest-neighbor upscale, orthographic isometric camera |
| Server | Node.js + Express + Socket.io |
| Networking | WebSockets, 60-tick authoritative server loop |
| Tests | Vitest (server-side) |

The server is the single source of truth — all physics, collision, and damage run server-side. Clients send raw inputs and render interpolated state snapshots.
